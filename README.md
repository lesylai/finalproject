# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. For details on how to fork and turn in the project, see section 3 of the github education  [documentation](https://education.github.com/guide/forks). After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project will create an interactive visualization that teaches viewers about color cognition. The visualization will illustrate pilot results from my research on the colors modified from the Berkeley Color Project. 

To view this project, Under construction... (embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).

## The data

Description of data:
These are pilot data from the experiment. 
Emotion ratings, color appearance ratings for colors (modified from Berkeley Color Project). Ratings are averaged across two repetitions in the experiment and across subjects. 

## Background

[documentation] (http://www.pnas.org/content/107/19/8877/F1.expansion.html)

There has been on going research investigating various aspects of color cognition using the colors modified from the Berkeley Color Project. Findings regarding this colorset however were published in separate papers. Even within the same paper, different results were presented in separated figures. This leads to a somewhat non-intuitive presentation of the findings given that color cognition involves a rich network of associations that viewers experience on the spot. In this project, I want to make a visualization presents various findings in ways that mimic the experience of color cognition in real life. 

## This project

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?

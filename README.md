# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. For details on how to fork and turn in the project, see section 3 of the github education  [documentation](https://education.github.com/guide/forks). After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project will create an interactive visualization that teaches viewers about color cognition. The visualization will illustrate pilot results from my research on the colors modified from the Berkeley Color Project. 

To view this project, Under construction... (embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).

## The data
Color cognition experiment results presented as color coordinates in CIE xyY space.  


## Background

In the world of digital monitors, colors are made of numerical values that represent a color's relative location in the color space. Human color perception is described as changes in the three axises as follows: hue, lightness and chroma. Unlike color naming, properties of the perceived colors vary along these three axises in a non-discrete manner. However, people often think of colors as categorical variables (e.g. blue is sad and yellow is happy). This can be misleading as research on color associations (e.g. emotion, semantics) found that hue has relatively little influence on viewers' color cognition. The goad of this project is to visualize research findings on color perception in ways that encourage viewers to perceive colors as a continuous variable moving along the three critical axises.

## This project



### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data? 
The colors are not only aesthetic attributes but also data itself. I hope mapping numbers directly onto the percepts of colors can give viewers some intuition about the continuity in colors rather than discrete categories. 

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

The transition of the background colors signifies the characteristics of color space. Although it would be ideal if the change in distance in color space is not proportional to the scale of the slider, so to reflect the actual nonlinearity of the color space. 

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
